Kurt Russell I should have known that okay cool dope okay this movie was cool kudos to him though for one arm and Doc even though he is crazy he's crazy dude I I mean like he's a character but like still kind of lovable in his own way all right yeah I don't know this movie was so fun definitely I've never watched anything with like a western like spin on it or not necessarily spin I feel like is this considered a western what is considered a western I'm I'm I've never watched a movie like this I've never seen anything like it um it is a it is an American Western film all right so this is my first Western and I don't know it's fun they're kind of funny they're crazy it feels like there's no rules like they're just out here being like it's the Wild Wild West baby I'm I'm here for it I really like this movie I don't and then like I don't know I just also there's some there's some bangers from the 90s dude the 90s was getting it for movies and I don't know if it's just because they kind of got to like dabble in like the first of some things like are there other you know like I feel like like the Matrix you know like that's the 90s right um like I was kind of bringing that up like yeah like 1999 right you get this movie Tombstone what else have have I watched um like Good Fellas exactly 1990 I don't know I'm like in the 90s I'm liking the block of time right there for movies because this one is again like the the filming the type of whatever cameras they were using where it doesn't look so digital and I also think the use of practical effects just makes it fun and artistic in a way that like CGI is cool and it is it's its own thing but I don't know like when you have more practical effects mix in and like just the Wardrobe and this crazy storyline like too so just has this crazy storyline and it's like everybody's just being wild there's it's almost like There are rules but they're like really defining it in that time so yeah but I am sorry I didn't recognize Kurt Russell I've only really watched him in um the thing and even then like he looks a little it it's the mustache dude like he looked familiar but in the thing I think he has like a full beard at one point um let's see I have Facebook in this so I swear like I just don't ever recognize Kurt Russell the thing he has a beard yeah and like that long shaggy 80s hair uh for its time for 82 but like any much younger I feel like in the thing like he he's a little bit more um aged in Tombstone not in a bad way like Kurt Russell is absolutely a heartthrob he probably knows that he's a beautiful man oh and we can all admit it okay I don't care who you are Kurt Russell is a beautiful man um but yeah like he had a full beard so I it's the eyes though he has very distinct like this portion of his face is very distinct regardless of anything else that you're being shown so I was like I didn't feel like I know who that is um also whoever the guy but he wasn't really that big of a character the guy that was with the the girl that was doing all the the shows and the acting who ends up getting killed later on um but yeah I don't know a very beautiful movie I really like the the landscape shots uh just like some b-roll that they get of like people you know riding around and being badass on their horses like I don't know it's just cool this movie's just cool I don't care what you say it's just fun I've just never seen anything like it so maybe that's why I'm I enjoyed it so much or it's just a simple fact that maybe this is a pretty pretty cool movie it's pretty Kick-Ass so yeah well thanks guys for watching along with me I can't wait to see what we jump into next together I will see you next time bye
